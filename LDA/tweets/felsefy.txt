The worst customer service ever! They don't even respond to my emails!! @AirCanada @AirCanada I already submit my request, yet still waiting for Mrs. Miller to respond! Such a terrible customer service! Literally the worst! @AirCanada I also couldn't reach any of your customer reps. What kind of service is this? @AirCanada Flew on Sunday! I lost time and plus I waited 5 hours in Frankfurt! This is not FAIR! @AirCanada I waited 5 hours in Frankfurt and my direct flight turn into indirect flight! I also lost one day! I suppose to fly on Sat but... @AirCanada My "direct" flight from Istanbul to Toronto cancelled for no reason! And I'm forced to take indirect flight to Toronto! Always do good things for people, one day it would pay off. Always striving to make my day better. Small changes make big difference...
